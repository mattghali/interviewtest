## Question 8
A co-worker in San Francisco reports trouble accessing a company website in Japan. The site is hosted on a Linux system, and the user's Mac runs Mac OS X. Assuming you have unrestricted access (physical/logical) to company infrastructure, how would you debug this issue? List any commands you might use, and discuss other components of the system (besides the two computers) you might check.
